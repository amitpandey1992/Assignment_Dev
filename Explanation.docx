Ansible EC2 creation through Dynamic Inventory
	 
1. I have configured dynamic inventory to create ec2 instance.
		 
2. For Dynamic inventory, I have downloaded ec2.py and ec2.ini scripts, EC2 external inventory script and Ansible EC2 external inventory script settings.
 
3. I have set environment variable for
		export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key_id>
		export  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
		 
4.  We  need to set path for  
		 
        export  EC2_INI_PATH=/home/ubuntu/Assignment_Dev/create_EC2/dynamic_host/ec2.ini
	export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/home/ubuntu/Assignment_Dev/create_EC2/dynamic_host/ec2.py
	 
	and make ec2.py script executable
		chmod +x  /home/ubuntu/Assignment_Dev/create_EC2/dynamic_host/ec2.py

5. Once above setup done just need to run ec2.py script it will fetch info about all the AWS resources which configured inside ec2.ini
